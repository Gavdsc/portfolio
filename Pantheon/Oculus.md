# Oculus

## Overview

Oculus is the primary ERP application offering from Pantheon Automatisering.
It servers as the main business management application for several companies, serving thousands of users.

Todo: MVC, not MVC, iframe structure, RPG -> net.data / PHP -> JavaScript, IBM-i & DB2.

### My Role:

Key technologies:
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- CSS/SCSS
- HTML

#### Maintenance:
General maintenance of the Oculus software has been an on-going part of my work over the last 5 years.

Bugs are handled as tasks in Jira and assigned to developers via scrum-style sprints. Sprints culminate in minor releases after testing and quality control.

I've been responsible for fixing all forms of bugs, from vanilla JavaScript to CSS.

The legacy code is best described as complicated, uncommented, spaghetti. Small fixes are often complicated by improper practices (such as multiple nested layers of !important styles), and impacts are hard to predict. Working at Pantheon has equipped me with a toolkit capable of dealing with difficult and legacy codebases. 

#### Refactor
Oculus is a monolith built on 16 year old software. This includes a vast amount of legacy technical debt, ranging from Javascript
to html and CSS.
