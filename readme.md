## A Pantheon Portfolio

When I joined Pantheon Automatisering in 2019, I began working on closed-source projects running on internal client platforms. This was a departure from my previous work, where I often boosted my visible portfolio with public projects.

Since then, the world and the web have evolved. Many of the projects and companies I worked with before Pantheon have ceased to exist, leaving my public portfolio somewhat sparse.

This temporary repository serves to showcase and provide visuals for some of the projects and responsibilities I have undertaken at Pantheon over the past five years.

While working at Pantheon, project management has been controlled using Jira/internal solutions, and version control using git and github.
